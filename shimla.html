		<h2>Shimla Tour Packages FAQs</h2>
		<div class="faqs">
			<h3>Q. Which is the best time to visit Shimla in the summer?</h3>
			<p>
				A. There are several Shimla tour packages that aim at bringing the summer tourist from the plains. But it is imperative to know the peak season for summer travels to Shimla. Shimla in the months between March and June offer a perfect respite from the heat of the plains with the temperatures lingering between 15 and 30 degree Celsius. The days are warm and pleasant with a cool breeze blowing in from the mountains and breaking a quick hot spell. It is the time adventure activities in and around Shimla gather steam. Go trekking, paragliding, white water rafting, camping. If not, walk around Shimla’s vibrant Mall Road, eat at its cafes, visit the Lakkad Bazaar, the iconic Christ Church, Jakhu Temple and the Tara Devi Temple, and soak up the atmospherics of this erstwhile colonial hill station.
			</p>
			<h3>Q. What are the adventure activities I can pursue in Shimla?</h3>
			<p>
				A. For an adventure enthusiast, just any of the Shimla travel packages won’t do. Your itinerary needs to cater to your desire for the adrenaline. Shimla has some avant-garde trekking slopes on the Himalayan ranges. A popular mountain trek is to the Tara Devi Temple nestled on a hilltop. Begin from the Tara Devi Railway Station and climb 4 kilometre uphill to the temple. You can go rafting on the Satluj River. A 12-kilometre stretch starting from Chabba and winding up in Tattapani, it is a haven for white-water enthusiasts. December to February is the time for ice-skating where you have powdery snow, crisp air and clear skies to take on some of Shimla’s extensive ice-skating zones. Places like Mahasu Ridge in Kufri and Hattu Peak in Narkanda offer perfect skiing slopes for the skiing enthusiasts. For some golfing, head to Shimla’s oldest golf course in Naldehra. Mountain bicycling and paragliding are among your other adventure sport options.
			</p>

			<p>
				A. Shimla is highly multilingual.

The conditions gently peter out by mid-September. The evenings can be chilly and rains could derail your sightseeing plans.
